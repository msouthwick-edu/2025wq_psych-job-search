# Where to Search

- Take time to set up accounts and troubleshoot
- Take time to exchange with neighbors and the group of other organizations or places that they've found jobs positions at

# How to Search

- Brainstorm with neighbors and Maia of positions they're interested in
- Take time to generate search terms via ChatGPT
- Take time to set up a search alert

# What Comes Up

- Compare with neighbors the positions you've found.
  - How do the benefits differ?
  - How do the descriptions differ?
  
# Next Steps

- Schedule a time or start date for your job search. Stick to it. Treat it like a part-time position.
- Find someone who can do sniff tests for you. It can be the neighbor you chatted with today, a close friend or family member, or an advisor. Ultimately, the positions you apply for and the jobs you take is your choice, but it'll be good to have someone who can help you look out for red flags.
