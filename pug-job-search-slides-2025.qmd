```

We will be focusing on **identifying positions**:

::: {.incremental}
- Requires some understanding of your job needs and career goals (e.g., [using online assessments](https://www.imaginephd.com/users/sign-in))
- Learning where you can find open positions
- Learning how to implement effective search strategies
- Discern between roles that align with your needs and expectations and those that don't.
  - Tailor your application materials to the position ahead of submitting.
:::

<!-- Recognition of privilege; some people may have more time or support to be "picky", while others have other pressures that are driving their financial and professional decisions. Respect that.-->

# Step 1: Where to Search

## Previous Experience

**How have you found an open role in the past?**

- *Post in the chat or unmute!*

<!-- 1. Pose this question and have folks unmute or respond in the chat.
2. Add this to a chalkboard in Quarto presentation. Click 'D' to download drawings.
Sometimes one of the hardest things of any new process, -->

## Identifying Potential Employers & Open Positions
*Chapter 1*

::: {.incremental}
- Job Boards
    - LinkedIn, Handshake, Indeed, & more
- Organizations' Career Pages
- Events
- Networking & Informal Channels + Cold Outreach
:::

<!-- refer to Ch. 1 in the reader for this part, if you want.
1. Job Boards: These can either be an open online community where hiring managers and companies post job ads, closed community spaces with job postings, or job ad aggregation sites which scrape the internet for posted job ads on other sites. 
  a. this could include sites like Indeed, Handshake, and LinkedIn (amongst others).
2. Career Pages: You can often times apply through an organization's website itself. This is direct, but makes searching a bit less efficient.

Other ways include seeking out connections with employers, whether that's by attending events such as career fairs, joining professional networks, or doing "cold outreach" (i.e., initiating contact with a hiring manager or someone else who could refer you to an open position). 

We'll focus on navigating LinkedIn for a job search, as many of the skills we'll talk about could translate to other job search strategies.
-->

## But wait... a Q&A!

Questions about...

  - Psych-specific job boards?
  - Norms for reaching out to others about jobs?
  - ahhhhh!? üò¨ 

<!-- 2-5 minutes -->

## LinkedIn: An Introduction
*Chapter 1, Section 2.1*

::: {.incremental}
- At this point... Professionalized Facebook
- BUT useful for a variety of reasons:
    - Job board
    - Networking
    - Building an online presence
- Let's check it out... 
:::

<!-- 
Originally a professional networking site, LinkedIn has expanded to cover multiple functionalities. This includes hosting job ads, learning courses, running news articles and more (including puzzles). 
-->

## Setting Up an Account
*Optional, but it'll be a part of future activities*

1. Go to linkedin.com: https://www.linkedin.com/.
2. Click ‚ÄúJoin now‚Äù under the three sign-in options.
3. Continue to fill out the information requested.

**Post in chat, DM me, or unmute if you have any questions.** 
**Once you're done, raise your hand.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00) 
```

<!-- Who has an account already? 
If no one, have them take time to set-up an account and be on call for questions ~ 3 minutes.

When you're done, raise your hand or post in the chat.

You will need this for later in the workshop.

# Step 2: How to Search

## Points to Consider in a Job Search
*Chapter 2*

::: {.incremental}
- Be open-minded
- Be cautious
- Be patient
:::

<!-- Searching for a job may be hard for some, and easy for others.

At the end of the day, you are putting yourself out into the world, and you're going to have to make some decisions.

1. Be open-minded to positions that you would not have thought to apply to on your own. Broaden your options without necessarily lowering your standards.
2. Be cautious: you'll likely be applying to entry-level roles, so be sure to ask questions to potential employers about expectations for new hires and know what you can and CAN't compromise on when it comes to pay and benefits.
3. Be patient: applying for multiple roles requires some degree of persistence. Find ways to take care of yourself during this process.
-->

## Navigating the "Jobs" Section
*Chapter 2, Section 2*

- Hopping over to LinkedIn!
- Be able to identify the:
    a. Search box
    b. Set-up a search alert
    c. Job postings

<!-- Look at reader and go through key terms, and parts of the job baord -->

## Your Turn! {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- What are are some example job titles?
    - Post in chat or on the whiteboard.
- Let's try another way! [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/)
    - Example job titles: [https://tinyurl.com/mppvyf49](https://careercenter.ucdavis.edu/career-discovery/undergraduate-students/what-can-i-do/majors-data?mcid=191)
    - Possible [job families](https://www.imaginephd.com/job-families) (https://www.imaginephd.com/job-families) or https://www.science.org/content/article/myidp.
    - Take a couple minutes to generate some search terms
    - You could even ask ChatGPT, "What are some job titles for entry-level roles requiring a psychology degree?"
        - Feel free to push it to be more specific.
        - Find other prompts here (UCD Career Center: [https://careercenter.ucdavis.edu/resumes-and-materials/using-ai](https://careercenter.ucdavis.edu/resumes-and-materials/using-ai))
    - We'll come back to share what we've found.
:::    

```{r, echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00) 
```

<!-- - Take time to generate search terms via ChatGPT:

Here is what I asked ChatGPT, ‚ÄúWhat are some related keywords to a behavior technician position?‚Äù. It generated keywords related to the role I was interested in (Behavior Technician), skills, work environment, and more. For our purposes, we will use the ‚ÄòGeneral Role Keywords‚Äô to plug into our LinkedIn search. However, you can use the other keyword output as search terms too.

~ 2 minutes for people to try, then ask for term

-->

## What did you find?
*Post in the chat or unmute.*

## Actually Searching {.smaller}
*Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2*

After putting in key terms, there are a couple of different things you can do:

    - Salary
:::

::: {.column width="60%" .incremental}

# Step 3: What Comes Up

## What are you looking for in a role? What's important to you?
*Chapter 3, Section 1*

- *Post in the chat or unmute!*


<!-- Feel free to give examples: PAY, location, benefits, sponsorship, job type, upwards mobility, flexible schedule, good workplace culture, effective management;
Plug in the reader, as it also has links to the UCD Career page on how to "do your own research".
-->

## What comprises a job posting?

![](li_search_result.jpg){fig-align="center"}

<!-- For this section, we will be referring to this UCD Research Analyst position as a running example. The LinkedIn posting can be found here. While this section is referring to a LinkedIn job posting, these components can be found in job ads on other platforms. However, it‚Äôs likely that other job postings do not contain all of the elements below, or they may contain additional elements. -->

## Job Summary

![](sample-job-description.jpg){fig-align="center"}

<!-- The first portion of a job posting will likely contain a paragraph description of the job‚Äôs position within an organization and primary roles and responsibilities. This will provide a good gist of how the employer would expect someone to succeed in the position. -->

## Qualifications

![](sample-job-qualifications.jpg){fig-alt="image of a job qualifications" fig-align="center" width=400pt} 

**Consider applying even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications!**

<!-- Next, a job posting will list the hiring team‚Äôs expectations of skills, experience, and/or education deemed necessary to succeed in the position. Any necessary qualifications could be labeled as ‚ÄúMust Haves‚Äù, ‚ÄúMinimum Qualifications‚Äù, ‚ÄúRequired Qualifications‚Äù, and more. -->

<!-- Sometimes, a posting will also list ‚ÄúPreferred Qualifications‚Äù or ‚ÄúNice-to-Haves‚Äù. These are skills, experience, and/or education not necessary for being considered for the role, but they may help you stand out as a job candidate. -->

## Job Responsibilities

![](sample-job-responsiblities.jpg){fig-alt="image of a job responsibilities" fig-align="center" width=400pt} 

<!-- The day-to-day tasks of a position will often be listed under a specific ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù section. If there‚Äôs limited information, you can ask for more clarification on responsibilities during the interview process. The responsibilities listed will also cue you in to the types of skills and experiences a hiring manager is looking for. -->

## Position Information

![](sample-position-information.jpg){fig-alt="image of a position details like pay" fig-align="center" width=400pt} 

<!-- Additional information on pay, frequency of pay, schedule, part-time/full-time status, and anything else relevant to what was discussed in the ‚ÄúFactors to Consider‚Äù section will be housed in some part of the job posting. If you cannot find any information on pay, type of work demands, schedule, and more, then you may need to conduct research on the company to better understand the position. You may also need to ask these questions during the interview process. -->

## Benefits

![](sample-job-benefits.jpg){fig-alt="image of a position details like pay" fig-align="center" width=400pt} 

<!-- The benefits section may describe types of non-wage compensation such as health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, paid vacation leave, paid sick leave, retirement plans (401k or 403b matching), and more. These are important parts of any job you take on, so if there is limited information on benefits, be sure to ask this during the interview process. 

The reader has a link to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' salary and employment trends for reference.
