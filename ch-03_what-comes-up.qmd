# Factors to Consider

As you being to sift through your search results, you need to consider multiple factors related to your personal situation, your future needs, and your potential employer. These factors can include:

- **Pay**: A position can offer wage compensation in the form of hourly wages or an annual salary amount (paid in biweekly or monthly intervals). 
- **Benefits**: Evaluate whether a position even comes with a benefits packages, and if so, then the components of that package. This is all nonwage compensation. A benefits package can include health/dental/vision insurance, paid time off (PTO), travel reimbursements, retirement plans, and more. Learn more about these [here](https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/benefit-packages).
- **Geographic location**: Some positions may require you to relocate to a new area. You will need to determine whether or not you are able and willing to move for a position. Some jobs may require you to travel or they may offer remote positions. Where a position is located and posted will also affect the true value of a posted salary or wage. High cost-of-living areas will require higher wages/salaries to live in than a low cost-of-living location. You can Google more on a city's cost of living or checkout this index [here](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_rankings_current.jsp?region=021).
- **Schedule**: Determine whether or not you're open to a fixed or variable schedule position. Fixed means a consistent schedule (e.g., Monday - Friday, 9-5pm). Variable schedule means the hours or shifts that you work each week may change from time-to-time. This can either mean increased flexibility or increased uncertainty in the hours that'll you'll be paid each week (if it's an hourly position).
- **Employer's mission**: The importance of this factor may vary from person-to-person. If working for an employer whose values matches yours, then you should investigate any public profiles or websites that they may have which states the company's mission and values.
- **Size of the company**: Larger companies may have more processes in place to support newer hires. Or they may experience higher turnover of employees. It depends on the industry and nature of the work. Smaller firms may have a more tight-knit culture or expect a
- **Employer's reputation**: You can conduct research on a company to see if any employee reviews appear. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) is a well-known website where current and past employees can post reviews about a company. The site will require you to sign-up and then submit either your own review, salary information, your interview experience, and/or benefits information about a company that you've worked at previously. Check out this site at your own discretion.

You will need to ask yourself, "what is your financial  and employment situation now, and what will it be once you graduate?".

Refer to this UCD Career Center's page on ["Do Your Own Research"](https://careercenter.ucdavis.edu/interviews-and-offers/offers-and-negotiations) for more on important factors to consider. While the page suggests evaluating this during the final stage of a job search (offer and negotiations), you should be thinking about these factors earlier on.
