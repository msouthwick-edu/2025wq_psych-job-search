    "text": "As you being to sift through your search results, you need to consider multiple factors related to your personal situation, your future needs, and your potential employer. These factors can include:\n\n\n\nFactor\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPay\nA position can offer wage compensation in the form of hourly wages or an annual salary amount (paid in biweekly or monthly intervals).\n\n\nBenefits\nEvaluate whether a position even comes with a benefits packages, and if so, then the components of that package. This is all nonwage compensation. A benefits package can include health/dental/vision insurance, paid time off (PTO), travel reimbursements, retirement plans, and more. Learn more about these here.\n\n\nGeographic location\nSome positions may require you to relocate to a new area. You will need to determine whether or not you are able and willing to move for a position. Some jobs may require you to travel or they may offer remote positions. Where a position is located and posted will also affect the true value of a posted salary or wage. High cost-of-living areas will require higher wages/salaries to live in than a low cost-of-living location. You can Google more on a city’s cost of living or checkout this index here\n\n\nSchedule\nDetermine whether or not you’re open to a fixed or variable schedule position. Fixed means a consistent schedule (e.g., Monday - Friday, 9-5pm). Variable schedule means the hours or shifts that you work each week may change from time-to-time. This can either mean increased flexibility or increased uncertainty in the hours that’ll you’ll be paid each week (if it’s an hourly position)\n\n\nEmployer’s mission\nThe importance of this factor may vary from person-to-person. If working for an employer whose values matches yours, then you should investigate any public profiles or websites that they may have which states the company’s mission and values.\n\n\nSize of the company\nLarger companies may have more processes in place to support newer hires. Or they may experience higher turnover of employees. It depends on the industry and nature of the work. Smaller firms may have a more tight-knit culture or expect a higher amount of work from each employee.\n\n\nEmployer’s reputation\nYou can conduct research on a company to see if any employee reviews appear. Glassdoor is a well-known website where current and past employees can post reviews about a company. The site will require you to sign-up and then submit either your own review, salary information, your interview experience, and/or benefits information about a company that you’ve worked at previously. Check out this site at your own discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou will need to ask yourself, “what is your financial and employment situation now, and what will it be once you graduate?”.\nRefer to this UCD Career Center’s page on “Do Your Own Research” for more on important factors to consider. While the page suggests evaluating this during the final stage of a job search (offer and negotiations), you should be thinking about these factors earlier on."

    "text": "For this workshop, we will be going over how to navigate the (mostly virtual) landscape as a job seeker. Below are categories for how someone may come across a job opportunity:\n\nJob boards/banks: These can either be an open online community where hiring managers and companies post job ads, closed community spaces with job postings, or job ad aggregation sites which scrape the internet for posted job ads on other sites. An example of an aggregation site is the ‘Jobs’ tab on Google search results pages. Sometimes these aggregation sites highlight jobs that are no longer available, so be mindful when using these.\nOrganizations’ career pages: Depending on the size and technical scope of a company/organization, their website may have a ‘Careers Page’ or ‘Job Portal’. Through these, you can sometimes sign-up to be notified when a new position is posted.\nEvents: In-person or virtual events where you can talk one-on-one with an organization\nNetworking and informal announcements: Receiving or being referred to positions via social connections or being a member of a community\nCold outreach: Directly reaching out to an organization or recruiter and asking for positions. A ‘recruiter’ is someone whose job is to find job candidates for a company. We will not be going over this in the reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThere is going to be a lot of information listed in this workshop reader! We will be focusing on select sections for the live discussion, but feel free to peruse the other sections at a later date. If you get overwhelmed or unsure about how to handle all of this information, you can reach out to me (msouthwick@ucdavis.edu), an undergraduate advisor, or even an advisor at the Career Center!"

This includes hosting job ads, learning courses (formely Lynda.com), running news articles and more (including puzzles).\nThere are over 230 million users in the US alone (LinkedIn, 2024). It is a highly used site by companies and individual workers alike. If you do not already have an account, you will need one in order to browse and apply to roles posted on LinkedIn.\n\n2.1.1 Signing Up\nFor this workshop, we will be exploring LinkedIn Jobs. You will need to set-up an account.\nIf you haven’t set-up one already, you can do it now:\n\nGo to linkedin.com.\nClick “Join now” under the three sign-in options.\nContinue to fill out the information requested. You will likely use this account after you complete your undergraduate degree, and so signing up with a personal email is suggested. You can add your university email as a secondary email under Settings &gt;&gt; Sign in & security &gt;&gt; Email addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWith your student email, you can sign up for courses on LinkedIn Learning for free (mostly). If you’re want to upskill in a specific area, you can check out this courses and add completion of them to your LinkedIn profile. However, be mindful of services that request payment, whether it’s on LinkedIn or elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Creating a Profile\nYou can connect with classmates, coworkers, and friends. There’s nothing incredibly special about having a large number of connections, especially when it comes to securing a job. The main benefit of having more connections is catching when someone re-posts or posts a job ad. This could be relevant when you’re looking at organizations you may want to work at, but they do not have any current openings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLearn some best practices for building out your LinkedIn profile!

    "text": "Finding a full-time job is an intensive process. It can be overwhelming yet exciting to see all of the possibilities for the next chapter of your life.\nThere’s an aspect of vulnerability in the job search. You’re summarizing all of the experiences and skills you believe are relevant to a position into a single application, submitting it, and waiting to be judged in a way that will could significantly changed your life.\nRejections are going to happen, or even worse, you won’t receive any response from an employer on the status of your application. As you go on this journey, a little advice:\nBe…\n\nOpen-minded: There could job titles or positions you may not be aware of that match your interests and/or skillset. You can focus your job search on a certain role, but read through job descriptions to make sure they’re aligning with your own career priorities. Try to expand your search to include titles that are adjacent to your interests. You can search or ask ChatGPT about suggested job titles based on your goals or current skill set.\nCautious: In the face of mounting rejections or if the job search drags on, a reasonable reaction is to lower your standards for the type of position you’re willing to take on. While managing your expectations for an entry-level role is appropriate, accepting a position at a company that exploits desperate or naive job seekers may set you on an untowardly career path.\n\nBecause there’s always going to be rent due at the end of the month, it’s okay to take on a temporary or part-time job.\nIf there are restrictions on the types of positions you can work post-grad (i.e., international students), UCD students and alumni have access to GoinGlobal. They advertise resources for H1B visa holders.\n\nPatient (with yourself): Find ways to demonstrate kindness to yourself during this process. Stay connected with those who matter to you, build in moments of care or play into your everyday routine, and treat the job search as a part-time job. Dedicate time to the search, but once the job is done for the day, fill your time in other ways."

    "title": "Ch. 2: How to Search?",
    "section": "2.2 Search Terms",
    "text": "2.2 Search Terms\nTo begin your search, you need to put in key words in the search box. This means knowing what types of roles you are interested in. Below is a sample set of keywords for different job types, generated from ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024).\nHere is what I asked ChatGPT, “What are some related keywords to a behavior technician position?”. It generated keywords related to the role I was interested in (Behavior Technician), skills, work environment, and more. For our purposes, we will use the ‘General Role Keywords’ to plug into our LinkedIn search. However, you can use the other keyword output as search terms too.\nAdditionally, the other keyword output could also be helpful when you’re trying to craft a resume as long as you’re accurately and honestly representing your skills and experiences. Sometimes recruiters and hiring managers use automated programs to filter resumes (for better or for worse cough cough), and so having relevant keywords in your resume could be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Type\nKeywords\n\n\n\n\nBehavior Technician\napplied behavioral analysis, registered behavior technician, behavioral therapy, intervention specialist, autism spectrum disorder\n\n\nClassroom Support\nclassroom assistant, teacher’s aide, instructional assistant, paraprofessional, learning support\n\n\n\nA list of relevant, entry-level job titles can be found here (for Psychology) and here (for Cognitive Science). You can loop some of the titles listed into your search strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe term ‘research’ in job search land is pretty broad. Across all fields and industries, there is research being done. This means when typing in “research” or any type of broad keyword, you will end up with a set of search results that are highly irrelevant. Mess around with your search terms and filters to see what produces relevant job positions.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Filtering\nDepending on how narrow of search terms you are using, you may need to apply additional filters to produce a manageable output of results. Knowing your personal needs in a job search is also important for filtering. For example, you need to know what locations you’re willing to live and work at, and you can apply that preference via the “Location” under “All filters” or in the search box.\nA breakdown of each of the available filters can be found on this LinkedIn help page. Review this, while keeping in mind the below information:\n\nExperience level: There are different levels of roles within a company based on experience (professional or educational). For most soon-to-graduate undergrads, “Entry level” positions are a close match for the roles you’ll be looking for. “Associate” titles are often reserved more senior roles requiring more experience. You can use the “Internship” level in your search, but it may show both paid and unpaid opportunities.\nEasy Apply: The “Easy Apply” button is only offered on some job postings, not all. It’s easy on the job seeker, as when you Easy Apply you do not need to switch to a new website and re-input a bunch of information. It means you can apply to a higher number of positions. The drawbacks are: (1) it’s harder to customize your application for a particular position; and (2) if applying is easy for you, it’s easier for other job applicants. This means you’ll likely be competing with a larger pool of applicants. Learn more about it here.\nSalary: Read below.\n\nApplying filters can be helpful; however, the organizations and hiring teams posting jobs on LinkedIn vary greatly in the level of information they may put in their job ad that allows for easy filtering. For example, if you narrow your search by a certain salary level, this may leave out roles that do not have any pay information posted in their ad. This issue will differ between states with pay transparency laws being passed in recent years (learn more here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMess around with search terms and filters to see how changes to your search may produce differing results. For example, you can test what types of “Internship” opportunities crop up when you select “Internship” under “Experience Level”. The search could show a job opportunity that matches well with your goals (e.g., a paid internship that promises the chance of a full-time role in a company), so learn about the platform you’re using before limiting your search.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Setting Up Search Alerts\n\nOnce you’ve input your desired search terms and applied your filters, you can click on “Set alert” at the top of the results to be directly notified of any new job postings. This is of use for more readily applying to new roles as they appear and reducing the need to completely re-do a search.\n\n\n\nAfter you have switched on the search alert, you will be receive on a pop-up message in the lower-left hand corner of your screen. From there you can click on “Manage alerts”, see your saved search on the screen (as indicated by the search key words and selected filters), click on the grey pencil, and then change the alert frequency (daily or weekly) and notification type (email and/or LinkedIn notification).\n\nYou can get to this same screen from the “Jobs” homepage. Click on the “Jobs” tab in LinkedIn, click on “Preferences” on the left-hand side, and click on “Job alerts”.\n\n\n \n\nAs mentioned earlier, if there’s an organization that you’re interested in, you can “Follow” an organization.\n\nYou can either follow the people associated with the organization who may be likely to re-post job ads. You can find these by going to the ‘People’ tab. OR, to avoid spamming your homepage with strangers’ posts…\nYou can go to the ‘Jobs’ page, click on ‘Create job alert’, and put in the type of roles you’re interested in and what locations you’d be open to working at. See the image below for an example.\nBe sure to review the types of positions that individuals under the ‘People’ tab may have that you’re interested in and determine where common work locations are (either what’s listed as the head quarters location under company’s name or in the ‘About’ tab).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Managing Search Alerts in Your Inbox\nIf you begin setting up all of these search alerts across different sites, your inbox may start getting overloaded with emails. You can filter any incoming emails from specified senders using “rules”. Gmail and Microsoft Outlook have different approaches on how to do this.\n\nCreate rules to filter your emails in Gmail\nManaging email messages by using rules in Microsoft Outlook\nUse filters to organize Yahoo Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBeing quick to apply is in your favor if a submission deadline is not specified. However, ensure you’re submitting quality materials for the application. We will not be covering crafting a resume in full for this workshop."

Career Pages: You can often times apply through an organization’s website itself. This is direct, but makes searching a bit less efficient.\nOther ways include seeking out connections with employers, whether that’s by attending events such as career fairs, joining professional networks, or doing “cold outreach” (i.e., initiating contact with a hiring manager or someone else who could refer you to an open position).\nWe’ll focus on navigating LinkedIn for a job search, as many of the skills we’ll talk about could translate to other job search strategies."
