For the workshop, we will actively discuss job search strategies. We will also leave this workshop having completed tangible steps towards finding a full-time role.

However, the [UC Davis Career Center](https://careercenter.ucdavis.edu) has robust resources on career planning, job search strategy, and more. These are geared towards the general undergraduate population, but you can [meet with a Career Center advisor](https://careercenter.ucdavis.edu/career-center-services/career-advising) to discuss tailored job search strategy.
